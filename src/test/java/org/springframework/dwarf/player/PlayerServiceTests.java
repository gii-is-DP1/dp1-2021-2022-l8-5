/**
 * Integration test of the Service and the Repository layer.
 * <p>
 * ClinicServiceSpringDataJpaTests subclasses benefit from the following services provided
 * by the Spring TestContext Framework:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Spring IoC container caching</strong> which spares us unnecessary set up
 * time between test execution.</li>
 * <li><strong>Dependency Injection</strong> of test fixture instances, meaning that we
 * don't need to perform application context lookups. See the use of
 * {@link Autowired @Autowired} on the <code>{@link
 * PlayerServiceTests#clinicService clinicService}</code> instance variable, which uses
 * autowiring <em>by type</em>.
 * <li><strong>Transaction management</strong>, meaning each test method is executed in
 * its own transaction, which is automatically rolled back by default. Thus, even if tests
 * insert or otherwise change database state, there is no need for a teardown or cleanup
 * script.
 * <li>An {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext ApplicationContext} is
 * also inherited and can be used for explicit bean lookup if necessary.</li>
 * </ul>
